# **This is my personal website**
This website will become a portfolio of all my works as well as a way for me to expand my coding skills. There will be several challenges along the way. 

## **Short Term Goals**
- [ ] Make media queries more coherent, in index.css the media query changes the view for desktop to mobile but in projects.css its goes mobile to desktop, this isnt a huge issue as both work but it makes it confusing when going back and forth between individual files and trying to style for mobile/desktop.

	- [X] Complete Mobile Navigation Bar
