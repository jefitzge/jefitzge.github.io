# **This is my personal website**
This website will become a portfolio of all my works as well as a way for me to expand my coding skills. There will be several challenges along the way. 

## **Goals**
- [X] Complete Navigation Bar
	- [ ] Add new animation to navigation bar and adjust style
	- [X] Complete Mobile Navigation Bar
- [ ] Complete Projects page
	-[ ] Add a nvigation style bar that catagorizes each project by type(ex: Language, hardware, software etc)
		-[ ] Using buttons that link to specific part of a page, projects of similar type should be in their own container
	- [X] Add sample project

- [ ] Make media queries more coherent, in index.css the media query changes the view for desktop to mobile but in projects.css its goes mobile to desktop, this isnt a huge issue as both work but it makes it confusing when going back and forth between individual files and trying to style for mobile/desktop.
